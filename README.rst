Why Musixmatch API interface
============================

It all started because I've known many `people at Musixmatch`_ for a long time,
but still didn't understand what they were starting up. So I gived a look at
their `API`_ and soon loved the design.  Writing the first library sketch was
so fun that i decided to keep going and i wrote the python-musixmatch.  On top
of the package I'm going to build a `Plone`_ product as sample application,
then I'll take the chance to start developing with some frameworks I'm not
familiar with, like `Pylons/Pyramid`_, `Turbogears`_, `Grok`_ and last, but not
least, `Django`_
