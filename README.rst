Why Musixmatch API
==================

It all started because I've known many people at `Musixmatch
http://musixmatch.com/about_us/`_ for a long time, but still didn't understand
what they were starting up. So I gived a look at their `API
https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation`_ and soon loved the design.
Writing the first library sketch was so fun that i decided to keep going and i
wrote the python-musixmatch.  On top of the package I'm going to build a `Plone
http://plone.org`_ product as sample application, then I'll take the chance to
start developing with some frameworks I'm not familiar with, like
`Pylons/Pyramid http://pylonsproject.org`_, `Turbogears
http://turbogears.org`_, `Grok http://grok.zope.org`_ and last, but not least,
`Django https://www.djangoproject.com`_
